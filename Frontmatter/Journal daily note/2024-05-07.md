I feel utterly unwanted.
I feel like a waste of space.
I feel like I have nothing to offer.

I feel like I will always be a waste of space.

How tf do i ***manifest*** some help, or some guidance??? I am dumbfounded, stuck, lost, disillusioned.

I desire joy. I desire the ability to **be in the moment**. I want to be present and stop worrying about that which I cannot control.

How do I get back all of the time that I lost? Can I recover the time that was stolen from me? Can I rewrite my identity and stop playing the victim?

If I could right just one of the wrongs that happened to my inner child...
Education...
Thats what I would redo...

I feel so much sorrow about my unstable education experience.
I have always been a curious soul. There are so many subjects that I find endlessly fascinating.
How can I determine which one to latch on to.

I feel such a deep and dark pit that cuts me down, all the way from my chest to my sacral
these sensation matter, and so does the mystic perspective

damn, my chakras... are shot

My heart... is certainly broken.
My solar plexus is cut off, I cannot find the energy or motivation to try anything new.

I need to learn how to integrate all of my energy centers

It feels like I am just way too far to catch up.
> this is a lie. It has to be. What's really in my way, other than my own ego? My victim mentality. It's ***my*** mindset. the SET of my MIND.
