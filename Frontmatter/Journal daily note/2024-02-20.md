why do *we* refuse to look at it in HD?

HOLY SHIT I AM BEING WAY TO AUTISTIC ABOUT THIS

My main point

FUCK

The people of this country (including me(you, & probably most of the people you know)) ARE ***LAZY*** AS FUCK.

Aint no goddamn employee wanna fucking think about the larger impact of their action/inactions. People refuse to even attempt to try to or become capable of projecting into the distant future how their behaviors will impact themselves let alone some stranger they couldnt muster the courtesy to give a flying fuck about

WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
NONE OF US ARE SEPARATE
NOTHING HAPPENS IN A VACUUM
>obviously this is not literally true as space is a vacuum and we exist on a planet 'inside' it
>> what I am meaning to point at is the fact that *pretty much* anything anyone will ever do **always** affects the whole
>> YES I REALLY DO MEAN WHAT I AM SAYING
>>> For much of the (mostly) stupid crap we do, there is no *'real'* *'observable'* effect _-*(&&*%*(E(@#_+())))
BASICALY I AM CITING THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT

FUCK HOW CAN I JUST GET THIS SHIT OUT SO THAT I CAN JUST NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT GOING DEEP INTO THOUGHT AND THEN FORGETTING IT ALL.

such a fucking waste of energy....

it makes me hate myself when i do that.

i WiSH i KneW hoW tO STrUckture sentences and apply grammar

I guess I do to a considerable degree, it doesnt show up in casual conversation which moves to fast for me

I think I am just "an overly serious person"

I cannot stand to see how people take for granted the fact that like...

fuck...

ANYTHING EVEN EXISTS AT ALL????

I know, it must seem fucking insane that I even think about this at all.
Never in my entire life have I heard ANYONE talking about 'this' in an open space or in public
Stating the obvious, as I obviously tend to do (dont mind the redundancy, please and thank you) this is why I acknowledge that my prior statement must sound "CRAZY".

FUCK
I curse. too much. Agh.

ANY FUCKING WAY

...come on just spit it out...

I think I may be a "gestalt processor"

I have these big 'ol thoughts running through my mind.
Trying to explain this exemplifies the perceived 'issue'

When I am 'inside my mind' letting shit run and flow, its a mix of different types of mediums which are ever so fleeting. Images, sounds(sometimes my inner(inaudible(i can hear it but not really)?)'voice'), and I guess 'raw' logical expressions. All the instances of these mediums ebb and flow quite rapidly into one another and are so very hard to keep track of.

AAAAAND I JUST LOST MY 'train of thought'
maybe I'll come back to it later

...probably not...
:/
