Dear God,

					that you should go fuck yourself
					JKJK and also I love you
					and so doth your creator

	nigga?
	nope did'nt think so

I often find myself overwhelmed by the fact that I have no damn clue what I am doing... what my life is. People say this is only natural for my age. I think I can finally agree.

Theres no wifi here at this shiiiitty hotel.
It be like that sometimes.

I love my life. I guess?
I dunno... much of anything really. And thats okay. It'll be okay once I learn to accept it. I think I'm getting there. Slowly.

Maybe thats the problem, maybe that's what's halting my progress. I *think*; therfore, I AM THAT I AM.
	would it look cool and edgy if i replaced 'therfore' with thoes 3 little dots that are use in math? yes.
		I couldnt find it in the character map lol
IDEk.

I have a *tendency* to "overthink". LOL
Thats an understatement. Just then I stopped myself in the moment from typing ***I think** thats an understatement*.
Where was I going with that?
I dunno.

nu line new thought

ONE OF MY OBSESSIONS:
Why do our modern implementations of english suck so hard?

agh. nu thought just popped

wouldnt it be cool to create a webapp where people can allow notifications whenever I add to my never-ending-thought-journal?

Like, once I push my daily thoughts to a git server that is linked to a web domain(making it accessible through a web browser) if someone has been to my repository and enabled notifications, then they would see whenever I just typed out my thoughts. I could add a feature that allows them to respond or add feedback. I would probably make an effort to make it anonymous on all ends, this would add an engaging mystery.

I hate how so much of ___ is ___ seen through the lens of "*how can I make money with this ((**thing**)person,place,idea)?*"

Why does money always have to be involved in the ways in which we interact with the world. I mean yeah, (fiat) currencies are really cool because they allow us so much flexibility in how we spend our priceless life force energy
	so, [[for some reason]] we are all given a life
		The life that we are given can and will leave us someday, there is no way around this(yet)
			On top of this all to often phenomena that is taken for granted
			WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW, WHEN, OR WHY we will be *removed*
				This makes our time and energy PRICELESS
					nonetheless we are required(not really) to give in and set a price for our efforts
						(OR HAVE ONE SET FOR US :/)
					
i GUES WAHt I aM TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

maybe our (fiat)currencies are

***too*** *flexible*

~~i feel like it should be spelt *flex***ABLE***~~

I hate america. LOL.
God without the capital 'G' is disrespectful

WE HAVE BECOME A NATION OF **MEGA PUSSY-ASSED-B I T CHES**

WE SUCK..,,.,.,, fR, FR

But foReal tho...
We have abdicated our individual responsABILITY()
	as citizens, as The People
and we have traded our "RiGhTs" for cheap comforts that are slowly killing us and are causing us to (en masse) live lives that are straight the fuck up **DISRESPECTFUL** TO THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE

yOU KNOW, THAT THING THAT PEOPLE REFER TO AS "GOD"

ᶾ that symbol is used to represent the phonetic sound zh or j.
Obviously, Sometimes G can sound like J.

Hey, my name starts with the letter J!

ᶾ also looks like 3. I happen to really like the number 3.
It *is* a really good number, dont you agree?

I wonder if I could legally cahnge my name to ᶾamuson.

My nickname is now ᶾAMO.

I wish our english were written with phonetical accuracy in mind.

ᶾaemau
