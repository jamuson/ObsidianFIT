Why do I feel the need to complicate every thing in my life?
Where is this coming from? Where is this perfectionism coming from?
It’s like nothing that anyone (including myself) does will ever be good enough for me.

I am an extreme loner. I dont *really* have any friends. I never did. I have had people in my life who would come around to hang out, but I have ***never*** felt like I was able to actually connect with anyone in my life. In my mind I tend to just blame this on my situation growing up. I have pretended like moving around all the time is what has caused me to be a shut in. But I think tha maybe there is just something about me that is broken, like my brain is broken.
	I have had this thought for a while and I think I have intellectualized this to a severe degree. I think that I “have” <u>autism</u>. I think this may be the case because of my premature birth. My theory is that my prefrontal cortex is basically fucked because I was not *cooked* long enough. I *did* have a considerably early birth. My prefrontal cortex simply was not developed fully.
		I think of it like this: look at any other mammal’s face. What makes the structure of our face different from theirs? They have long snouts while we have flatter faces.

The prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain located at the front of the frontal lobe. [It plays a crucial role in a variety of complex behaviors and greatly contributes to personality development](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/prefrontal-cortex)[1](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/prefrontal-cortex). Here are some of its key functions:

- [**Executive Function**: This includes controlling behavior and impulses, delaying instant gratification, regulating emotions, planning, making decisions, solving problems, making long-term goals, balancing short-term rewards with future goals, changing behavior when situations change, seeing and predicting the consequences of behavior, and being able to focus attention](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699)[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699).
- [**Self-Reflection, Memory, and Emotional Processing**: The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in these functions](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/prefrontal-cortex)[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699).
- [**Sensory Processing, Motor Control, and Performance Monitoring**: These are the functions of the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC)](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699)[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699).
- [**Personality Expression and Social Cognition**: The prefrontal cortex is also known as the “personality center” and is involved in decision making, reasoning, personality expression, and social cognition](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/prefrontal-cortex)[3](https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/prefrontal-cortex).

[Damage to the prefrontal cortex can lead to changes in personality and behavior, problems with social behavior, an increase in antisocial behavior, and problems regulating emotions and impulses](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699)[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699). [Notable conditions associated with damage to the prefrontal cortex include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Schizophrenia](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699)[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/prefrontal-cortex-5220699).
