Today was... awesome?
We got a lot done, I think.

Fuck
	I am noticing that when I am typing I write "fuck" to indicate that I have a lot that i want to get out

Okay, so I was watching a video by [Hayden Ro-- something]. He was having an argument with some girl about their views on Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice.
ugh. Long story short, I couldn't help but imagine a system designed to facilitate more thorough intellectual adventures.

# idea one
- video is on screen

- press space to pause like normal
- press a button to record in response to speakers

# idea two
for live debates it could be useful to see a live preview of what a speaker has just said

A realtime logic map could be very helpful

common issue with debates
too much time is spend arguing about the nitty-gritty and whether or not the right definitions are being used and in which context. 
- transcribing each speaker is already a good idea
	- i want an algorithm that checks for logical consistency
		- it should alert participants when someone 
			- uses a fallacy
			- uses a definition wrong
