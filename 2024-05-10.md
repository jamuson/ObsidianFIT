AYO WTF.
1432

I HEARD THIS NUMBER IN MY HEAD BEFORE IT WAS SAID OUT LOUD

JARRED ASKED WHAT WE THOUGHT THE TOTAL WAS

JOSH SAID IT WAS EITHER 1300 OR 1500

I SAID THAT 1300 SOUNDED MORE ACCURATE 

THEN I HEARED 1432 IN MY HEAD

JARRED DELIBERATED TO HIMSELF OUT LOUD AND THEN SAID THAT WE WILL GO WITH 1432

WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED HERE

DONT SEE HOW THIS COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE
