0:00Check, check.

0:02I know the audio sucks, but I don't care, taking the time to reflect.

0:07I need to be creating stuff and saying stuff and working out my thoughts.

0:10Because if I, if I am predisposed to being a heavy thinker, I got two options, I can really lean into it and do something with it or I can do what everyone's been telling me to do and learn how to stop overthinking.

0:26Oh, you are overthinking.

0:28You are overthinking.

0:30You're too cerebral 
in relation to what your standards?

0:36I, I don't, I mean, sure.

0:38I mean that, that has weight, you know, and I, there are people that I care about me who 

I just had a I, I like what I like to call like when three different thoughts converge, they're like statements or propositions or things that I want to analyze.

1:04I say something and then these things emerge and then I lose focus and I'm like, wait, which one do I pick?

1:09And then they're too far down the river before I can even actually like, look at them because I, I couldn't see what they were because I was distracted by, where do I go?

1:21Right.

1:22So that's what I'm doing now and I just, I digressed, I went off on a tangent.

1:29OK, I can read back later.

1:33Whatever the hell that was.

1:37Ok.

1:39Do I need to preface everything?

1:40No, I, it's like I'm the only one who's gonna listen to this and honestly, if anyone else is ending up listening to this and I didn't say, hey, I want you to listen to this.

1:50No.

1:50What are you doing in my?

1:51You don't, you don't try to get in my head.

1:53OK?

1:54You couldn't handle it.

1:55I can't handle it.

1:55Maybe you can, I don't know, I'd be really impressed if someone could, but then that's not just me, you know, it'd be difficult like if you were to take an individual consciousness, like the consciousness itself or like the soul and then swap bodies with it and then have those different individual entities deal with the difference in like neural patterns.

2:19Like that would be, that'd be torture.

2:21That'd be really hard.

2:22That'd be really difficult.

2:23I think that's what happens to us.

2:25Like, when we reincarnate, I'm not actually convinced of anything ever at all.

2:28But reincarnation makes sense to me.

2:33And if it's not true, I would like to know, I personally don't think that I could have a logically transmittable conclusion.

2:46Like, I don't believe that's possible for me to see.

2:51That's like I have thoughts and then turning, I don't even know how it works.

2:54Like I just have like, how would you even explain that there are some people who can't, who don't do this either?

3:01They can't or they don't like, it's crazy for me to think that there are people who don't, not, not think like I do, but there are people who literally don't have the ability to have like an inner dialogue or picture things and that like that just doesn't make sense to me.

3:16That that's true, isn't it?

3:17That there are people who exist who cannot imagine things visually in their consciousness and their experience or whatever.

3:30There are people who don't have an inner dialogue which to me sounds like they don't think.

3:35And that, that's why it's like, I don't understand what were the implications of this?

3:38Like there's a, you can meet these people but scientists, people who have studied these things and pulled the empirical testable measurable data have said, yeah, there's people who like so they exist, they do.

3:57I am not one of those people.

4:01And like trying to relate to that.

4:03Like I feel like that's my whole life.

4:05I spend a lot of time in my head for better or worse, I think right now while I'm young and immature and don't know shit about the world or myself.

4:14It does.

4:15I don't know how to manage it.

4:16So that's what again, that's what this is me.

4:18This is what I'm doing right now.

4:19I'm trying to learn how to manage that because it's important.

4:26It's, it just is.

4:41Are you getting this out, please?

4:42One.

4:45What are you doing?

4:53Yeah.

5:05Let me see this.

5:10I know more.

5:22Ok.

6:16I don't know if II I was typing it out, maybe I'll just read it and it'll help me, go deeper starts with one.

6:28That's why I need to go back.

6:29I'm not thinking about this now, but what I was originally thinking about was how do I go back in time?

6:36I need to go back in time by creating a simpler life for myself.

6:41This song came into my mind and I was trying to find it.

6:45And I, I couldn't, I could just hear like two synth notes and like the mumblings of the lyrics.

6:54So I don't actually know the lyrics so I couldn't find it.

6:57So I'm like, hm, that sounds like it's an eighties song.

7:01So I went to look up like popular songs from the eighties and then I couldn't find it.

7:07I went through like 15 songs of 100.

7:18So like the website that I found was all just links to youtube and they were embedded in the web page so I could play and see the music video with it.

7:30Some avail were some were of course not available.

7:34So of course, I did, I had to skip, I'm too self conscious when I speak.

7:41Sorry, I just skipped those obviously.

7:45But I was just looking at, you know, I was comparing the visuals to what I have to reference from what I've seen in my life.

7:55And it's like, hmm.

7:56Wow.

7:57Really?

7:57Seems like everything back then was much simpler.

8:00I don't believe that it is.

8:01I had a conversation with a coworker today about, you know, I can't remember what someone said.

8:07I think I said something I might have chimed in and of course, I chimed because that's how I got involved in the conversation in the first place.

8:14But the world, the world has always been more complicated than we can imagine.

8:22There's always been a lot of, I resist saying evil, but I will say evil because it definitely exists.

8:29I personally do not believe that I am capable of objectively determining what that is.

8:34I think that's part of a human being, of being.

8:37I think that's part of being a human being and we can't forget that otherwise that leads us to dehumanize ourselves and other people.

8:46Everything is always up for a debate.

8:49We need to work.

8:50I need to work on maybe be an example if I can be productive with it to effectively deal with not taking advantage of the truth or taking it for granted.

9:04I wanna work on taking the truth for granted.

9:07And I think I always have put that in question, but I never knew how to deal with it.

9:10Like people are just like people.

9:12I'm, I'm very conf my way of existence seems to confuse a lot of people and hell, it confuses me too.

9:21I don't know why I'm like this.

9:26But I just have a hard time trusting anything.

9:30Anyone says.

9:31Even the people that I woke up to Jordan Peterson.

9:36I don't know what the hell is going on with that guy, but I don't know why I just get this vibe that he is transforming into something that is going to be notorious.

9:48But for different reasons, I'm not going to say good or bad, but I just feel this direction that he's walking into and i it's spooky.

9:57I'm not certain that it's gonna end up being a great thing, but, you know, maybe he's overstepping his boundaries.

10:04He said a lot of great things.

10:05There's no denying if you actually look at the situation that he has indirectly helped a lot of people by being an example of something that is going towards extinction, a certain type of energy.

10:22And I don't know if he's, yeah, I don't know.

10:27But what I wanted to talk about was the concept of this thing that people call.

10:37I don't even want to say anything like Voldemort.

10:38You know, the adversary, there is an adversary.

10:44I am not religious by any contempt.

10:46I'm not religious at all.

10:48I'm spiritual.

10:50That's what they say.

10:51Now, I'm spiritual.

10:52I'm not religious.

10:53I'm spiritual.

11:00If you consider yourself to be a spiritual person.

11:02It makes sense to look at the religions of the past.

11:11You know, there's no way that any of them said any, there's no way that any of the religions that exist don't have at least one thing.

11:22Right.

11:24But then there's so many religions and, you know, it's, it's part of, it's about feeling and emotion and reflecting and trying things out.

11:31Something sounds compelling and you can reason through it and you can say, you know what I'm compelled by that.

11:38I've done my best to check my bias and see if there's anything that I just want to believe because it's easy or for whatever reason, you know, you, you become, you gotta find the word for that.

11:51Right.

11:51So you're compelled by the religious idea, the state, the statements that came from the experience of another individual, right?

12:00You've tried to push it through logic the best that you can, which a lot of people don't do.

12:03That includes me.

12:04You know, it's a really hard thing to do.

12:05I do try.

12:06, but I'm not as earnest about it as I could and should be.

12:11So I don't, I don't think it's unfair to say that most people, most of the population, it doesn't do a great job at that.

12:20I definitely, there are a lot of people who are better at that than me.

12:23They might be younger than me.

12:24They might be the same age.

12:25They might be older, you know.

12:27But we, you know, we're all at different vectors.

12:30We are vectors.

12:31Very complicated duodecimal.

12:35Lots of dimensions are involved.

12:37And I'm talking about like, physical space and like time and stuff and like ti, well, kind of in a way.

12:44But we all have copious dimensions that all affect the velocity of our lives.

12:55Religion.

12:56Yeah, I don't identify as religious but I do have a religious background

13:02I never really got too involved in the ideas but definitely some things imprinted on my view of how things work,, directly and also through my parents who had a different relationship with the religion that we were involved with.

13:16, so I have some of those ideas, some of them, you know, make some kind of sense.

13:22There are aspects of Christianity that absolutely makes sense.

13:26But it's like, what exactly is the Bible?

13:28It's the word of God.

13:29Ok.

13:29But it's like, what is God?

13:33And to what degree is the Bible?

13:37Perfectly that, and maybe the answer is extremely obvious.

13:41, maybe it's unknowable.

13:43But like, you know, it, when we hear that the Bible is the word of God.

13:50And then we look at all of these different, various versions that say slightly different things and it's like, oh, it doesn't matter.

13:58Yeah, it does words matter, bro, different synonyms.

14:02They don't mean the same thing.

14:04They mean similar things and synonyms do not mean the same thing because if they meant the same thing, then it'd be absolutely redundant to even have a synonym for the word people.

14:12People are like, oh yeah, synonyms have the same meaning.

14:16Not exactly, it's like five plus three is eight, but so is seven plus one and so is four plus four.

14:24Those are all not the same thing.

14:28The conclusion is eight.

14:30The reasoning is, well, four and three or four and four together make eight.

14:36So that's the reasoning.

14:37But yeah, but also five plus three also equals eight.

14:40So those are different entities.

14:44They have different scheme on its like colors.

14:45It reminds me of this video I watched by this guy who, yeah, you know what I'm talking about Jo in this video about the logos, I think and like consciousness, how I perceive things and webs of ideas and associations and connotation and all these different various things.

15:14So I started off by thinking about how I need to go back in time.

15:19But that, I mean, like build a simpler life for myself because things were simpler.

15:23At least there was the illusion.

15:24But that illusion enabled people to live simple lives.

15:28So I think you could be even more powerful and cool or have more power for yourself and be more.

15:33I don't, I'm not using sophisticated words for this.

15:36I don't know why.

15:40But I think it'd be more respectable if I were able to create the simple life that used to exist that was not given to us if I can make it for myself, if I can learn how to, work, you know, my machines together, my mind, my physical body and that thing that they call the soul if that's even right.

16:02You know, I, I think that the idea of the soul is a, it, it points to something that actually exists is real.

16:11What do we mean by real?

16:12We're not going to go down that yet.

16:14We're not ready for those ideas or maybe, you know, I just don't know where to look.

16:18I don't know how to get the answer.

16:20I don't, I've accepted that.

16:21Maybe I'll never objectively know how to know what is real.

16:25I mean, like what is it?

16:27Explain it to me in a way that you are confident, absolutely confident about?

16:34Yeah.

16:36Ok.

16:37So to create a simpler life, I need to deal with my fear.

16:45You can't eradicate fear because fear is what makes us human man fear is what makes us human.

16:55A lot of the times our fear comes from our limitations or maybe our limitations come from our fear, maybe both, maybe neither and all of the above.

17:10So I've heard there's, there's like this Christian idea of like the fear of God.

17:15It's like, hm, as a young person, why, why would, why would Christians say that they are proud of their fear in God?

17:24They don't say that explicitly.

17:25A lot of the time.

17:26So I'm sure people have definitely said that and I don't think that's, you know, maybe seven years ago I would have made fun of someone for that.

17:33But yes, why is that something to be proud of?

17:38You know, why do you want to be afraid of the thing that you love the most?

17:42I, I don't think fear is actually a good word that fully communicates the idea because like if it did, then I wouldn't even be talking about it.

17:48I think just like God, you know, my God is a personal God.

17:53OK.

17:54That means that your God is going to be different from everyone else's God, but not really but yes, different.

18:07you know Him in a different way, you know it in a different way, you have a different relationship, a different understanding, a different way of being affected by the concept, the mere concept of that, the mere concept of the belief that you hold that you act upon because how can you believe in something if you don't act on that statement?

18:26Murder is bad?

18:27Ok.

18:27So now when you see murder on the TV, or in the streets, you think?

18:32Oh, that's bad, right?

18:36But how do you know it was murder?

18:37You definitely a death was occurred and her life was taken from one person by another.

18:43But do we know the situation?

18:44What, what is the chain of cause and events that lead up to this was self defense.

18:53Or see now I'm getting bored of this topic because there's a thing that you see, what is it?

19:00I don't know what that, what causes that.

19:01I don't know what causes me to lose track of what I'm talking about like that.

19:06I think my concentration is just awful and I don't spend enough time.

19:10There are speech,, neurons, there are sections of my brain that are not activating properly because I never developed them because I never learned how to talk to people because I moved all the damn time because my parents were raised by people who should not have been parents and also influenced by religious dogma.

19:30So, you know, I could choose to be angry about that, but I choose not to be angry about that because the only thing I can do about it is explore how the fuck to deal with that because there's no manual.

19:46Maybe the the Bible, the Bible is the manual.

19:48Maybe, I don't know.

19:52Hopefully I'll find out, maybe I never will with any level of certainty.

20:02I wonder how many words I've spoken.
