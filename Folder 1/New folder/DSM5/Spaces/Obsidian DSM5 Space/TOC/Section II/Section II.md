This section contains the diagnostic criteria approved for routine clinical use along with the ICD-9-CM codes (ICD-10 codes are shown parenthetically). For each mental disorder, the diagnostic criteria are followed by descriptive text to assist in diagnostic decision making. Where needed, specific recording procedures are presented with the diagnostic criteria to provide guidance in selecting the most appropriate code. In some cases, separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM are provided. Although not considered as official DSM-5 disorders, medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse effects of medication, as well as other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention (including additional ICD-9-CM V codes and forthcoming ICD-10-CM Z codes), are provided to indicate other reasons for a clinical visit such as environmental factors and relational problems. These codes are adapted from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and were neither reviewed nor approved as official DSM-5 diagnoses, but can provide additional context for a clinical formulation and treatment plan. These three components—the criteria and their descriptive text, the medication-induced movement disorders and other ad- verse effects of medication, and the descriptions of other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention—represent the key elements of the clinical diagnostic process and thus are presented together.
