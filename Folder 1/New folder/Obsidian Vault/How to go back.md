how do I go back in time?
---

I need to go back and in time
by creating a simpler life for myself

how do I do that
I must deal with my fears
develop my faith in that thing that we call God
We must always be able to feel fear. It is what makes us human.
We are all needed and loved
God needs us/created us out of necessity
because we are what god cannot be
imperfect
but actually he could and was before somehow?
jesus

and therefore, we are a part of god.
we are not god(s), we exist in the mind of god as thoughtforms bound to his laws of nature. 

I may even believe that Earth is the wife of god
earth is the womb that nurtures us so that we may be prepared for the next level, that which is inconcievable to us in our current, lesser states.

We may be a part of a great alchemical process of reacations

I think that God would be able to create rules for himself to not break, unless necessary?

Maybe God cannot read our minds and know what we want or even need if we dont allow him.

He can only help us if we let him in, such are the conditions for free will.

Maybe if we degrade our selves and volunteer for sin we allow the adversary into our minds so that it may know what our flesh desires, but it probably already knows after watching us for so long. We are so predictable to that force

It is of some importance to recognize that God created the adversary knowing full well the suffering that would come from its inception. This was a necessary part of the plan. A worthy and cunning adversary whose constitution was to be the direct opposite of our creator.

Honestly, what do you think an all powerful and unlimited being would do if it were not for us? We are its challenge. We give It a reason to care and to try. Maybe we are it's purpose? I think I remember the bible saying that we are the creation that God is the most proud of? That would make sense. I can see why the Adversary would be pissed about that. It was designed to be arrogant.

I do not think that we shall feel sorry for it, but at the same time its heart is unchangeable. But does it feel anything? Dont you think it would feel miserable being the epitome of evil? 

I wonder if evil people are "happy".
