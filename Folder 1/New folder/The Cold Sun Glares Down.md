# THE COLD SUN GLARES DOWN
not sure where this came from but it excites me

WHO: The Humans & Some Unspecified and Boringly Stoic/Advanced Alien Species far far away

These Dudes are highly efficient and slow
they *do not* waste a drop, of anything
> i.e. when their people die... they use every part of the past's(passed's??) biology to make everything from food(they do not cannabalize), medicine, tools, weapons(for which they have had little use for a while now)

> the aliens dont do a whole lot, not physically anyways.
>> they do however, think a lot. any they think *very quickly*.
>> they do not speak regularly, and have a tendency to speak very softly when they do
>>> they primarily communicate by projecting high fidelity thought forms to each others' minds. They appear to behave as a hive mind. This is partially true.
>>> they regularly separate their bodies
>>>> physical, astral(etheric/soul bodies), and their mental bodies
>>>> they are highly advanced practitioners in 'astral projection'
>>>>> they explore the cosmos through such means
>>>>>> through the use of sensory deprivation, meditation, chanting, 'binaural beats' (binaural rhythms)


> the unspecified alien species live very long lives as they take things extrordinarily slow. They hardly do anything other than what is necessary. What ever they do, they do it well.
>> They 'eat' finely tuned meals throughout their entire lives. This is a primary reason as to why they live such long lives.
>>> they do not eat for pleasure, except on special occasions.

> the way that they experience time is very unique in a few ways.

> their bodies act primarily as anchors so that they may experience what we call the third dimension.
