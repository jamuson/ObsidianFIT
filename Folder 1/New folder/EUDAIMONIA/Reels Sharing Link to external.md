The basic idea is a minimal app 
Ya know how when you go to share a 'Reel' from any of the various Social Media Platforms?

Yeah, so the app would basically use this common functionality to help Content Creators and Content Consumers interact in a more expedient and meaningful way, cutting out the "link in my bio crap"

The main way that this works:
when a Content Creator posts a video, they would link the unique content IDs to the proposed app.

When a Content Consumer 'shares' the video, the proposed app comes up as an option. The user or Content Consumer will select the proposed app which then finds the action paired with our app and moves the user/consumer to the desired means of interaction
this could be things like:
- A certain section in a full length section of traditional style 16:9 video
- polls
- creators website
- a product
