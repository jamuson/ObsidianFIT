holy fucking shit dude

everyday human stupidity and ignorance never ceases to amaze me

I'm on Travis' crew for the first time, we have a freaking 2 hour commute and for some reason everyone seems just fine with having NO AIRFLOW IN THE CAP WHEN ITS 74Â°F INSIDE. WHAT THE FUCK. THERE ARE FIVE BREATHING HUMAN FUCKING BEINGS IN THIS FUCKING TRUCK! HOW IN THE HELL DOES THIS NOT BOTHER ANYONE ENOUGH TO SAY ANYTHING?!?

I continue to overthink and justify NOT expressing my needs. Firstly, do they normally ride like this? Who am I to alter that? I don't think that it is unreasonable to assume that this is not a rare occurrence, that's just not probable. It's more likely that this is how they normally ride. FUCK. That's not not healthy! How could someone just not be aware? What the fuck. So then maybe there's just something wrong with *me*.
