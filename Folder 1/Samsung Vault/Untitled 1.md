it appears to me that we are like a very sophisticated alchemical reaction

we are made from gross base matter into something...
something which God deems necessary. Maybe he is trying to build something? 

freewill v determinism; why choose just one?

it's both. Transcend duality and you'll see it. 

there's a little story in the Torah or something... it's about why God *decided* to have a hand in our creation. God needs us, maybe as much as we need him? We are in this together. 

I look at the Gnostic perspective. It feels somewhat... blasphemous... in the way that the creator is characterized. 

it's just... people say that it is pointless for me to try to wrap my head around why the creator did things in the ways that he has. but I feel as if this is my way of getting closer to the lord. If only I could transfer what exists in my mind effortlessly
