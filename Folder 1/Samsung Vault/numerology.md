(28-36) Second Pinnacle 7 ^ShHMqHnv

(37-45) Third Pinnacle 5 ^UKjdBAWT

(45- ) Fourth Pinnacle 4 ^IcymtDAX

Pinnacles represent moments in your life in which you realize current goals and learn some of life's lessons. If you are at the beginning of a Pinnacle, then they can be used as a predictive tool to assist in managing your future. Your first Pinnacle begins at birth and lasts until around the age of 27. Your Second Pinnacle lasts through the next 9 years, and the Third Pinnacle lasts for 9 years after the Second Pinnacle has passed. Your Fourth Pinnacle picks up where the Third Pinnacle ends and lasts throughout the rest of your life.
 ^5bpqIaFx

A 7 Pinnacle marks a time for study, self-discovery and spiritual development. Your focus on the inner-self will bring out the loner in you. If your 7 is a First Pinnacle you will probably have to deal with a feeling of alienation. ^AhVqhXxu

A 7 in the Second Pinnacle demarks a time for further spiritual exploration and refinement of your understanding of yourself. ^ySThu6wV

A number 5 Pinnacle is a time of change. This is period in which you will cast off restraints and develop your personal freedom. You will learn to be flexible and adaptable, to hold your ground and not run from the changes which confront you. A number 5 Pinnacle is a time of change. This is period in which you will cast off restraints and develop your personal freedom. You will learn to be flexible and adaptable, to hold your ground and not run from the changes which confront you.  ^HG5BAnLY

You are in a period where you should be building a solid foundation on which to carry on your life. You may be building a home, family or career. Whatever you are doing, it is not a time in which you will or should take it easy.  ^5AizMCgm

Challenges ^LXfCKeHr

Challenges denote personal weaknesses and temptations you will have to overcome as well as strengths you should try to develop to fully realize your goals. The 4 Challenges have the same time frame as the 4 Pinnacles. ^hH6nK2AD

(0-27) First Challenge 6 ^ZBbgwk28

(28-36) Second Challenge 3 ^eH0LDntk

(37-45) Third Challenge 3 ^wWD1dAFl

(45- ) Fourth Challenge 0 ^fsJ3QJzE

A 6 Challenge marks a period in which you will learn to balance the needs of your family with your own. You will learn that true nurturing can only come from your heart. Your idealistic views of marriage may be shaken some, but if you learn to temper them some you will be happier and more secure on the other side of this Challenge.  ^B6IFNB4j

The Challenge the number 3 puts before you is to learn to speak truly from your heart. You will have to overcome the negative traits of the number 3, which include superficiality, hyperbole, egocentrism, gossiping and disorganization.  ^MZiVHDXu

The Challenge the number 3 puts before you is to learn to speak truly from your heart. You will have to overcome the negative traits of the number 3, which include superficiality, hyperbole, egocentrism, gossiping and disorganization.  ^teCy83Rt

The 0 challenge means the choice of what you do with your life is entirely yours. Yours is an old soul--you've already struggled through all the challenges of the other numbers. Your reward for completing these Challenges is free will. You may face all or any of the challenges of the numbers 1 through 9. You may simply drift through life without a destination or definite goals. Or, you may rise above the struggles of others and use this Challenge period to sculpt a life based on love, integrity, justice, and vision.

At first glance, this freedom to choose may seem like a vacation, but it isn't. Indeed, the gravity of the responsibility that comes with a 0 challenge is tremendous, because how you choose to address your 0 challenge will profoundly affect the lives of those around you, and, possibly, the entire world. ^Abf9z8qG

Cycles ^slDCohE9

(0-28) Seed Cycle 11 ^6OsnQSbk

(29-56) Fruit Cycle 5 ^RndKrZof

(57-84) Harvest Cycle 2 ^piSncxWq

An 11 cycle is a period of great personal growth and attainment of spiritual knowledge. As they develop, carriers of an 11 cycle will be expected to lead, educate and inspire humankind. ^o3V8oj8a

Change and the development of personal freedom are the earmarks of a 5 Cycle. You will find fulfillment and joy in the adventures this Cycle holds for you. This Cycle will show you life at its most exciting.  ^NnSMrScT

You will develop at a slow, even pace. Your talents for peacemaking and gentle persuasion will come into play often. Understanding relationships will be your main goal in this period. Should this be your Third Cycle, patience and diplomacy will be the characteristics of this Cycle.  ^cV0ufS9C

Cycles occur in 28 year periods. The First Cycle last from birth through your 28th year and is called your Formative or Seed Cycle. The Second Cycle--your Productive or Fruit Cycle--begins at age 29 and lasts through your 56th year. The Third Cycle, your Harvest Cycle, begins with the coming of your 57th year and lasts throughout the rest of your life. Your Cycle Numbers tell you the lessons you must learn and goals you must meet to stay on your Life's Path and achieve your true destiny. ^MMeX4ZSR

Your Life Path Number represents the path you should take through life and the talents and skills you have to make your journey a rewarding one.

A 9 Life Path will lead you to look at all with love, compassion and tolerance. You will explore the connection that exists between all the things in our universe. You will learn to let go of your own desires to serve the better good of all of us. In whatever field you choose, your endeavors will help heal the wounds life inflicts on those around you. It is your mission to make our world a gentler, kinder place for all of us.  ^GHungueV

Your Destiny Number sheds light on those things you must accomplish in your life in order to be fulfilled.

You are destined to succeed in whatever arena you choose to enter. You were born to lead, and so long as you do not become dictatorial, you should fulfill your destiny to its fullest.  ^tcXDZIII

Your Soul Number describes your deepest desires and dreams, revealing your inner, private self, your underlying motivations, and your most ingrained attitudes.

You inner desire is to lead--to take control of the world around you. Since your talents lend themselves to this desire it is very likely your desires will be fully satisfied.  ^R4f7iIjJ

Your Personality Number reveals the "external you"--the personality traits others will know you by. It can also signify your appearance and the image you present, as well as your personal appeal and the environments in which you feel most comfortable.

The 9 Personality embodies mankind's highest principles. 9s are tolerant of all and feel a genuine love for everyone. Their compassion and willingness to try to heal others is boundless. Often your intuitive powers will lead you to the root of others' strife long before even they know from where their troubles sprang. You radiate warmth and care for others. You rarely act impulsively, but once you do take action it almost always results in success. People will love you and respect you for the pureness of the goodness which resides in you.  ^rOAYTPg0

Your Maturity Number reveals the person you will come to be--your true self.

Those with an 8 as their Maturity Number will find rewards through their accomplishments. Their early lives will be spent learning how to apply power without becoming dictatorial and finding a balance between the material and spiritual world. As you mature you will be called upon more and more often to lead others. If you learn to apply authority without becoming tyrannical you may well be thought of as one of the world's great leaders in your later years.  ^GX3AS7lJ

As long as your life is on an even or uplifting keel, balance numbers are relatively dormant. However, in those times when your life is out of order your Balance Number can become central to resolving the turmoil you are experiencing. Your Balance Number reflects the traits you need to bring to the forefront in order the get through difficult periods with the least amount of damage or time wasted on negative influences.

A 1 Balance Number indicates you need to rely on your creativity and innate courage to help you through troubled times. While you may be a "go it alone" type person, during stressful periods it would be to your benefit to seek the counsel and aid of others. Do not shut yourself off from friends and family. ^NjnkInhL

Karmic Lessons ^BAiJ66Ai

2 ^P3vSnLLe

6 ^ZiLawfSf

7 ^kqxzrkDW

8 ^vyvWjTEY

Karmic Lesson numbers reveal areas in which we need to grow. To become more complete, we need to give extra attention to these areas in this lifetime. If one of your 5 core numbers is the same as a Karmic Lesson Number, the significance of the Karmic Lesson Number is reduced. ^mvO1j0PE

indicates a need to learn the arts of diplomacy and tact. Try to be more sensitive to the feelings of those around you. Make an effort to learn to work with others as a team. ^agCp61lS

denotes an inability or reluctance to make commitments. Even when you do commit yourself to something it may be your nature to hold back any true passion for the commitment or relationship. Over time you might do well to slowly allow your passions to express themselves and put your heart into your commitments and relationships.
 ^pU1E2q06

points to a talent for making money that is not properly governed. You may experience tremendous swings in your financial status. This is because while you know how to make money, you also tend to be way too speculative and impulsive when dealing with matters of finance. Try and develop a more cautious approach to money matters and it is possible these swings in fortune will diminish.

The number 8 appears in your core numbers, so the importance of this number is lessened. ^5QpkLzOr

signifies you may be neglecting your innate talents. Whether it is a lack of will or fear of failure, it appears you are not devoting enough time and energy to honing those talents that are core to your being. You know what you are best at, so embrace it. ^KIsoMfIn

Your Personal Lucky Number does not change. This number will be lucky for your entire life. Your luck derived from this number will be strongest when you are addressing events and issues related to the general meaning of the number. Lucky Numbers should not be relied on to constantly produce positive results, or to make impulsive, high risk gambles. They simply mean that where they appear, you have an edge. How large an edge is impossible to determine, but seems to increase with the number of occurrences your Lucky Number is associated with for a given event or issue.

Those with a Personal Lucky Number 3 are indeed very lucky. The 3 is considered by many to be the luckiest number of all. Your 3 will benefit you most in situations requiring creativity and original solutions. The 3 is also a great money and love number. Just remember that as powerful as your 3 is, it is still not wise to take impulsive risks. That is, don't bet your savings on a horse just because it is wearing the number 3 and in the 3 post position. The horse still needs to be able to run! ^YQTYhRwy

Lucky Number 3 ^Zjqmi8pa

Signature Number 3 ^HE64eH8G

Signature numbers are based on how you sign your name. Your signature carries the power and the faults of one of the base 9 numbers. You may actually want to sign different documents with different signatures to reap the benefit of a particular number. For instance, if you are signing an agreement of partnership you might want to alter your signature to reflect the powers of the number 2.

The signature you entered is a 3. A 3 signature is good when dealing with creative endeavors. ^g5ECtrdr

Birthday/Gift Number 5 ^WV8E7YaN

Personal Year 5 ^RKVJnCwx

Your Personal Lucky Number does not change. This number will be lucky for your entire life. Your luck derived from this number will be strongest when you are addressing events and issues related to the general meaning of the number.

That is, don't bet your savings on a horse just because it is wearing the number 3 and in the 3 post position. The horse still needs to be able to run! ^KPLjWIza

This number tells you what is happening in your life this year. This number should be used to help you avoid setbacks and focus your energies on those areas of your life where you are most likely to achieve your goals.

You are in a year of change. This is a good time to move in new directions, take a few risks. A 5 year is also a time when your curiosity is at its zenith. Make time to sate your inquisitiveness, travel, and explore interests which you have never made time for before. ^gSeTJEU0

Foundation Letter J ^nrlkfCXC

First Vowel A ^nUg0DBnD

End Letter N ^63KQRx5f

Having a J Foundation Letter denotes someone who will bring justice to a project or venture. You do your best to ensure all are treated fairly. ^M1DjTPV8

Having an A First Vowel suggest you may be far more determined to succeed than you let on. ^298HoW2M

Having an N End Letter identifies someone who can bring innovative ideas to a project or venture, but their free-thinking spirit may not allow them to see a pursuit through to the finish. ^1sMWV9jS
