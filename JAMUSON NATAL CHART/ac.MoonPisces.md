# The Moon in Pisces

Lunar Pisceans are known to be dreamy and not always in touch with reality. However, though You may not always show real-world savvy in day-to-day, practical affairs, You make up for this with remarkable intuition. You can put Yourself into anybody's shoes with extreme ease. On the plus side, this endows You with remarkable compassion and love. The downside of this apparent ability to break down boundaries is that You can easily lose Yourself in the suffering of others.

Your sense of humor is delightfully silly and a bit odd. These are perceptive souls who seem to be in touch with all the nuances and subtleties of human nature. Often this comes through in a strong sense of humor that is more of the receptive kind than the type of sense of humor that would make people the "life of the party." It's generally pretty easy to get You giggling.

Moon in Pisces people may get tagged as spaced out, but there's much more to You than meets the eye. You feel things out and rely on Your intuition--it just doesn't feel right for You to do otherwise. Your dreaminess can mean plenty of moments of absent-mindedness. These times of oblivion can land You in all sorts of predicaments with others who can too easily misunderstand these complex souls.

Without plenty of space and time to daydream, Pisces Moons easily get overloaded with life. Give Yourself room to be alone with Yourself, and You're generally able to take on the world--even if Your style is not always conventional or understandable when You do so.

Generally considered soft-hearted and sweet, Lunar Pisceans care about others and are easily touched by human suffering. This tendency gains You the reputation as suckers for sob stories. Although this may sometimes be true, many Lunar Pisceans learn, in Your lifetimes, how to discern between sincerity and manipulation. Still, You definitely do have plenty of soft corners.

In personal relationships, Lunar Pisceans are giving and yielding. You are generally open on a sexual level, quietly. Your fantasies can be far-reaching, intricate, and rich with emotion. Love is closely tied in with Your sexuality. Most Lunar Pisceans are shy; You need a trustworthy lover to bring You out.

There's a delightful accepting side to Moon in Pisces that is sometimes mistaken for weakness. Pisces is the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac and thus carries with it a little of each sign of the zodiac. As a result, You see Yourself reflected in the behavior of others, giving You seemingly boundless compassion. Since the Moon represents our instinctive nature, Moon in Pisces seems to know how things feel without actual experience. The ones that aren't too shy make awesome actors and actresses. This ability to empathize even in the absence of experience gives You an open mind and heart. Most long to express this through writing, music (both listening and making), poetry, and art -- in fact, the happiest people with this position do just that.

Most Pisces Moon people instinctively know when they're due for a much-needed recharge. It's at these times that You retreat from the world (and its harsh realities) only to gather the strength to face everything and everyone again. Solitude is important to You, but You also need people, so Your retreats will usually be short-lived. Pisces Moon individuals believe, and, let's face it, the world needs Piscean leaps of faith.
