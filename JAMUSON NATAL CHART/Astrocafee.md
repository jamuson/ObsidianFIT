[[ac.MoonPisces]]


#### Moon in X: The Moon in the tenth house


Changes of situation. You are concerned about getting old or feeling too dependent on others, tending to hark back to the past. Perhaps more strongly influenced by the father. Help from family or women can be notable on professional levels.

This position of the Moon indicates an emotional need for recognition, popularity, acknowledgment, and achievement. You may feel others expect a lot from you.

You can be quite charismatic. You are at your emotional best when you lead a structured and responsible life, but it can take time to get there. You may change your goals, ambitions, and/or your profession frequently in an attempt to find the perfect fit. There can be marked worries about living up to your image or the expectations of others. You could find that your private life becomes public more often than most.

At times, decisions may be too emotionally biased, or you might act on emotional whims far too often. Learning to set your own heartfelt goals is the challenge here, as it is unlikely you will find true happiness if you follow or adopt the expectations of others, which you are especially sensitive to. ==You are talented at taking on a nurturing or managerial role and quickly adapting to trends.== 

##### 115 🛆 between the Moon and Mercury

You are quite expressive and animated in your speech. Not only do you have an outstanding memory, but you also pick up a lot of information from your environment. You love to chat and exchange ideas. Even if you are shy, once you're friends, you love to talk about pretty much anything under the sun, and you enjoy sharing stories from your past!

Much of the time, your communications tend to center around day-to-day activities more than grander philosophies. Naturally interested and approachable, others find you very easy to talk to. You are accommodating and curious, but you are not as well-equipped to handle heavy emotional demands. You thrive on change and variety. You might be a little addicted to gossip! More probably, however, you have a deep curiosity about others.

There is a twinkle in your eyes, and you are never short on humor. You are playful and versatile--you make a fun companion and an interesting friend. You listen! Yes, you do talk and occasionally interrupt in your excitement, but you are interested in what others have to say, which is a real pleasure. In fact, you are more able than most people to get others talking simply because you are very receptive and sympathetic. You also pick up others' feelings and body language readily.

###### Key traits:

You have sound judgment, a good memory. You are intelligent, imaginative, vivacious, and vibrant. You develop, adapt, and grow throughout life. This aspect combination adds a youthful, lively quality to the personality. There is a great need to express Yourself, whether through conversation or the written word. When emotions are overwhelming or stuck, writing could help. You may have an aptitude for, or interest in, learning foreign languages.

##### -36 ▢ between the Moon and Saturn

When the Moon is in hard aspect to Saturn in the natal chart, You need to learn to trust others more. Fear keeps You from fully enjoying personal relationships, and fear is behind the occasional rigidity that You express. When You let Yourself receive nurture or care from others, an inner voice cautions You that it might not be sincere, long-lasting, or enough! There can be some reluctance about becoming a parent, but once taken on, You don't take Your responsibility lightly.

Emotional reticence is the main theme of these aspects. Many people with this aspect had a lot of conditions placed on the love they received in early childhood. You tend to expect the same later in life. With hard Saturn aspects, individuals are often plagued with doubts, not only about the self but about what to expect from life itself. The problem is that expecting difficulties or negative situations creates an aura around You that perpetuates the problem. ==You must work hard at positive thinking and expecting more from life==. Ironically, many people with hard Saturn aspects can be quite sarcastic, skeptical, and rigid in manner. This is essentially a defense mechanism designed to protect Yourself from harshness in the world.

It is extremely likely that You feel neglected because You perceive it in the first place, and later expect it, to be the case. There's a vicious circle going on here that can only be broken when the patterns created by negative conditioning are broken. Adjusting one's perceptions and expectations is the key to breaking out of these negative patterns. Otherwise, natives of hard Moon-Saturn aspects will live life feeling left out--attracting circumstances that perpetuate a feeling of deep unhappiness and dissatisfaction.

###### Short description:
You have changeable moods, a reserved character, can be stubborn and may lack assurance. Your relationship with a guardian may have been difficult or a challenging early family life %%in some cases%%.

##### -81 ▢ between the Moon and Ascendant

You can be unhappily influenced by the family or childhood, or otherwise feel rather insecure about new beginnings and new situations. You may be always looking for more love, appreciation, and feedback. You are susceptible, perhaps with some superficial sensitivity and can sometimes be irascible, changeable, inconstant, and moody. However, You are usually highly intelligent, observant, and adaptable, and are very often misunderstood, projecting the wrong image more often than is comfortable.

You are a person who thinks of all the details that others forget. Your mind is almost always turned "on" which can make you a little nervous. You are excellent at sorting things out, organizing, and making lists and associations. With your attention to the details and the mechanics, however, you might miss the bigger point! ==You are exceptionally helpful and others can count on you for making arrangements, researching, and offering advice==. ==You truly love to feel useful==. ==You might have some traits of a hypochondriac==, as you notice all of the little aches and pains that others might overlook. Nervous tension could be at the root of many of your health complaints. Many of you are good at crafts, mechanics, or anything that requires good manual dexterity.

### Venus in Sagittarius

When Venus in Sagittarius people are in love, You need to feel You can grow and expand Your horizons through Your relationship. You want to learn new things, and experience everything together. ==You are an idealistic lover who wants them to appreciate their beliefs, visions, and ideals==. ==You can be a confusing mix of the lighthearted and serious==. You are a roamer and a seeker, and don't commit in Your relationships as easily as others. You turn others on with Your big smiles and laughs, Your jokes, Your grand schemes, Your dreams, and Your friendly, flirtatious behavior. ==You pride Yourself on Your open mind, but you may notice You can be judgmental too==. You are threatened by inhibitions on the part of Your lover, dullness, and emotional overkill. You are restless, and won't put up with lovers who dwell on any one thing. When the going gets tough in Your relationship, You have an overwhelming need to run away. Usually this only means getting out and experiencing something new before You come back, but sometimes it can be for good. You are attracted to people who are in love with life. They don't need to be refined, polished, or graceful to win Your favor.

Pleasing Venus in Sagittarius involves allowing You lots of room in the relationship to grow. Avoid getting stuck in a rut, and understand Your need to move on. Learn to laugh, but take Your rants and raves seriously. Avoid criticizing Your beliefs, join You in debates, and philosophize along with You. When You feel the need for more experience, join You! Learn to look past Your clumsiness with you and your feelings, and avoid cornering You or forcing You to commit.


#### Venus in VII: Venus in the seventh house


Your fate can depend a lot on partnership. May connect for love, children, happy emotional life.

Harmony is most important to you, so it is unlikely you will attempt to dominate a lover. You are a peacemaker, sometimes going to great lengths to achieve a balanced, harmonious relationship. Be careful not to bend over backwards just to keep the peace--you may be taken advantage of. Your marriage partner may be especially attractive, charming, or well off. You are extremely attractive, agreeable, and charming, drawing others to you magnetically. You need an unusual amount of contact and exchange with a partner, and might find that you feel completely lost without one. Some of you might quickly enter into partnerships, perhaps too quickly and neither equipped nor prepared for the responsibilities that a long-term relationship demands. In some cases, there can be a shallow or materialistic interest in partners. Your hips and lower back may be special erogenous zones for you, or You may be especially attractive body parts.

##### 25 ✶ between Venus - Uranus

Independent in love. Your love life is rich, but possibly with passing love affairs. You can tire quickly and can be scared of losing Your liberty. Traditional marriage may not be for You. You have that little something that attracts others. You like amorous adventures or unusual pastimes, You are romantic, although a little detached or unpredictable. You are the eternal lover and are more likely to break something off than live untruly. You like art, anything new.

The ability to get along with--and accept--people from all walks of life as friends is strong with this position. You can readily see through insincerity in others. In relationships, tolerance is the most important "ingredient" to You. Your sexual preferences can be somewhat unconventional, and You may not be happy with a partner who tries to limit Your sexual expression. You are usually quite capable of maintaining relationships that require a great deal of freedom and tolerance, such as long-distance romances or set-ups in which partners are unable to see each other consistently. Your style in love can be somewhat free and breezy, and possibly noncommittal. You quite naturally accept the idea that Your partner might need some personal space and freedom.

##### 2 ☌ between Venus - Pluto

Your emotional and sex life can be powerful and rich. You live out truly passionate love affairs.

You can be highly devoted and passionate to the things (and people) You love. You can be quite persuasive.


## Mars

Mars represents the desire for action and physical energy.


### Mars in Libra

Mars in Libra natives often reflect about things before tey act. Decisiveness is not Your strong point, but You do, eventually, get things done. Many people with this position procrastinate, generally because You feel the need to weigh all of the alternatives before taking action.

Life isn't always fair%%, as Mars in Scorpio would say,%% but Mars in Libra will seldom accept this notion. These natives can easily get caught up in defending Yourself and others. ==Although Your overall goal is to live peacefully, You stir others up with Your desire to balance everything==. Still, ==You always play innocent when You are challenged, and can generally charm the birds out of the trees to win your favor==. ==Passive-aggressiveness is practically the hallmark of this position. You don't want to look like You are ever being mean or unfair, but aggression has to go somewhere! Too often, this results in sneaky behavior and subterfuge==. On the other hand, some Mars in Libra people turn the Mars energy into action, and You fight for Libran justice and fairness in the world.

The possibility of failure does not enter Your mind, although success itself is not as important to You as enjoyment and happiness are. Can be pleasantly competitive and good-humored.

##### 47 🛆 between Mars - Saturn
