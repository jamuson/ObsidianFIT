### The Sun is in Scorpio

Scorpios are known for their intensity. They are determined folk who absolutely throw themselves into whatever they do, but getting them to commit to something is rarely easy. In fact, it's better not to even try to "get them" to do anything. Solar Scorpios have their own mind. And, their primary motivation is unlikely to be prestige (like their Capricorn friends) or even authority (Leos can have that, too)--it's real power. Their power can be of the "behind the scenes" variety, just as long as they have it.  
  
To others, Scorpios seem to have plenty of willpower. They probably do. Scorpios know what they want and won't go out and grab it at the wrong moment. They sit back, watch (quite expertly), and then get it only when the moment is just right. It might seem like patience, but it's more likely their powerful skills at strategy at work. Scorpios aren't afraid of getting their hands (their bodies, their minds) dirty. The darker side of life intrigues them, and they're always ready to investigate.  
  
Scorpios never give up. They have tremendous staying power. They're not in the slightest intimidated by anybody or anything. Confrontations are not a problem. In fact, talk to any Scorpio about their lives, and you'll probably be in awe at all they've gone through. Trauma seems to follow them wherever they go. When Scorpio learns optimism, instead of expecting the worst, they'll find that they possess amazing regenerative powers -- the power to heal, create, and transform.  
  
Short description:

The work that you do and the services that you offer are very important to your sense of identity. To feel good about yourself, you need to be busy with daily activities and produce work you can be proud of. Advice: Focus on finding a suitable and rewarding avenue for expressing this part of you, being extra careful to choose an occupation in which you can express yourself. You are sensitive to criticism about your work, and you work best when you create your own schedule. Positive feedback for your services is important to you, but be careful not to over-identify with the appreciation you receive from others, as your work and your health suffer when you feel under-appreciated. Motivation to do a good job should come from within.  
  
Key points:  
  
They are helpful, concerned, detail-oriented, observant, competent but not hugely ambitious, and sometimes given to fretting. They could have many pets, various minor health issues or concerns, and a strong attachment to their work or routine.

Your identity rides on your sense of personal freedom. It can be quite a challenge to get you to do what you don't want to do, simply because you see any attempts by others to push you in a certain direction as threatening to your sense of freedom. You are a very dynamic person who questions tradition and authority, yet, paradoxically, you can be quite set in your ways! Although a humanitarian in many ways, you can be a little brusque when it comes to sentimentality or what you perceive to be excessive attachment to the past or to tradition. You can have a lot of nervous energy and defensiveness. It can be difficult to hold a 9 to 5 job or to develop steady routines. You work best when you can manage your own schedule, and you work in spurts. When you are hit with creative inspiration, you are capable of tremendous effort. However, you can be quite temperamental, and it is very hard for you to pour your hearts and souls into something that you don't "feel" for at the moment. You don't like superficiality or pretense, which is an admirable trait. However, your disdain for pretense can be problematic in a world where people are expected to perform whether they are inspired or not! You should try your best to channel your high levels of intuition, inventiveness, and spiritedness into creative endeavors or important causes. You might find that you encounter much less resistance in day-to-day life this way.

### The Moon is in Pisces

Lunar Pisceans are known to be dreamy and not always in touch with reality. However, though these people may not always show real-world savvy in day-to-day, practical affairs, they make up for this with remarkable intuition. They can put themselves into anybody's shoes with extreme ease. On the plus side, this endows them with remarkable compassion and love. The downside of this apparent ability to break down boundaries is that they can easily lose themselves in the suffering of others.  
  
Their sense of humor is delightfully silly and a bit odd. These are perceptive souls who seem to be in touch with all the nuances and subtleties of human nature. Often this comes through in a strong sense of humor that is more of the receptive kind than the type of sense of humor that would make people the "life of the party." It's generally pretty easy to get them giggling.  
  
Moon in Pisces people may get tagged as spaced out, but there's much more to them than meets the eye. They feel things out and rely on their intuition--it just doesn't feel right for them to do otherwise. Their dreaminess can mean plenty of moments of absent-mindedness. These times of oblivion can land them in all sorts of predicaments with others who can too easily misunderstand these complex souls.  
  
Without plenty of space and time to daydream, Pisces Moons easily get overloaded with life. Give them room to be alone with themselves, and they're generally able to take on the world--even if their style is not always conventional or understandable when they do so.  
  
Generally considered soft-hearted and sweet, Lunar Pisceans care about others and are easily touched by human suffering. This tendency gains them the reputation as suckers for sob stories. Although this may sometimes be true, many Lunar Pisceans learn, in their lifetimes, how to discern between sincerity and manipulation. Still, they definitely do have plenty of soft corners.  
  
In personal relationships, Lunar Pisceans are giving and yielding. They are generally open on a sexual level, quietly. Their fantasies can be far-reaching, intricate, and rich with emotion. Love is closely tied in with their sexuality. Most Lunar Pisceans are shy; they need a trustworthy lover to bring them out.  
  
There's a delightful accepting side to Moon in Pisces that is sometimes mistaken for weakness. Pisces is the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac and thus carries with it a little of each sign of the zodiac. As a result, they see themselves reflected in the behavior of others, giving them seemingly boundless compassion. Since the Moon represents our instinctive nature, Moon in Pisces seems to know how things feel without actual experience. The ones that aren't too shy make awesome actors and actresses. This ability to empathize even in the absence of experience gives them an open mind and heart. Most long to express this through writing, music (both listening and making), poetry, and art -- in fact, the happiest people with this position do just that.  
  
Most Pisces Moon people instinctively know when they're due for a much-needed recharge. It's at these times that they retreat from the world (and its harsh realities) only to gather the strength to face everything and everyone again. Solitude is important to them, but they also need people, so their retreats will usually be short-lived. Pisces Moon individuals believe, and, let's face it, the world needs Piscean leaps of faith.  
  
Short description:  
  
Imaginative, sharp insights. They are impressionable, with abundant imagination. Gentle, warm, humorous, artistic.  
  
Potential issues: troubles caused by too much sentimentality, worries, problems, unhealthy imagination, escapism, and nervousness.  
  

#### Moon in X: The Moon is in the tenth house

  
Changes of situation. They are concerned about getting old or feeling too dependent on others, tending to hark back to the past. Perhaps more strongly influenced by the father. Help from family or women can be notable on professional levels.  
  
This position of the Moon indicates an emotional need for recognition, popularity, acknowledgment, and achievement. You may feel others expect a lot from you.  
  
You can be quite charismatic. You are at your emotional best when you lead a structured and responsible life, but it can take time to get there. You may change your goals, ambitions, and/or your profession frequently in an attempt to find the perfect fit. There can be marked worries about living up to your image or the expectations of others. You could find that your private life becomes public more often than most.  
  
At times, decisions may be too emotionally biased, or you might act on emotional whims far too often. Learning to set your own heartfelt goals is the challenge here, as it is unlikely you will find true happiness if you follow or adopt the expectations of others, which you are especially sensitive to. You are talented at taking on a nurturing or managerial role and quickly adapting to trends.

You are quite expressive and animated in your speech. Not only do you have an outstanding memory, but you also pick up a lot of information from your environment. You love to chat and exchange ideas. Even if you are shy, once you're friends, you love to talk about pretty much anything under the sun, and you enjoy sharing stories from your past!  
  
Much of the time, your communications tend to center around day-to-day activities more than grander philosophies. Naturally interested and approachable, others find you very easy to talk to. You are accommodating and curious, but you are not as well-equipped to handle heavy emotional demands. You thrive on change and variety. You might be a little addicted to gossip! More probably, however, you have a deep curiosity about others.  
  
There is a twinkle in your eyes, and you are never short on humor. You are playful and versatile--you make a fun companion and an interesting friend. You listen! Yes, you do talk and occasionally interrupt in your excitement, but you are interested in what others have to say, which is a real pleasure. In fact, you are more able than most people to get others talking simply because you are very receptive and sympathetic. You also pick up others' feelings and body language readily.  
  
Key traits: They have sound judgment, a good memory. They are intelligent, imaginative, vivacious, and vibrant. They develop, adapt, and grow throughout life. This aspect combination adds a youthful, lively quality to the personality. There is a great need to express themselves, whether through conversation or the written word. When emotions are overwhelming or stuck, writing could help. They may have an aptitude for, or interest in, learning foreign languages.  
  
\-36 Square between the Moon and Saturn  
  
When the Moon is in hard aspect to Saturn in the natal chart, natives need to learn to trust others more. Fear keeps them from fully enjoying personal relationships, and fear is behind the occasional rigidity that they express. When they let themselves receive nurture or care from others, an inner voice cautions them that it might not be sincere, long-lasting, or enough! There can be some reluctance about becoming a parent, but once taken on, these people don't take their responsibility lightly.  
  
Emotional reticence is the main theme of these aspects. Many people with this aspect had a lot of conditions placed on the love they received in early childhood. They tend to expect the same later in life. With hard Saturn aspects, individuals are often plagued with doubts, not only about the self but about what to expect from life itself. The problem is that expecting difficulties or negative situations creates an aura around them that perpetuates the problem. They must work hard at positive thinking and expecting more from life. Ironically, many people with hard Saturn aspects can be quite sarcastic, skeptical, and rigid in manner. This is essentially a defense mechanism designed to protect themselves from harshness in the world.  
  
It is extremely likely that they feel neglected because they perceive it in the first place, and later expect it, to be the case. There's a vicious circle going on here that can only be broken when the patterns created by negative conditioning are broken. Adjusting one's perceptions and expectations is the key to breaking out of these negative patterns. Otherwise, natives of hard Moon-Saturn aspects will live life feeling left out--attracting circumstances that perpetuate a feeling of deep unhappiness and dissatisfaction.  
  
Short description: They have changeable moods, a reserved character, can be stubborn and may lack assurance. Their relationship with a guardian may have been difficult or a challenging early family life in some cases.  
  
\-81 Square between the Moon and Ascendant  
  
They can be unhappily influenced by the family or childhood, or otherwise feel rather insecure about new beginnings and new situations. They may be always looking for more love, appreciation, and feedback. They are susceptible, perhaps with some superficial sensitivity and can sometimes be irascible, changeable, inconstant, and moody. However, they are usually highly intelligent, observant, and adaptable, and is very often misunderstood, projecting the wrong image more often than is comfortable.
