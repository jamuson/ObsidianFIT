You are repeatedly forced to experience religious and ideology crisis and face doubts about the meaning of life. 
The world seems to You like a ship full of crazy people where no rules apply, and You are unable to find a meaningful place in it. 
You feel like trusting and naive outlanders, foreigners in Your own country, while others seem to You invulnerable. 
Your injury has a name - spleen.
