People with Jupiter in Gemini have a talent to get to know as many aspects of life as possible. It is basically how You get to know Yourself. However, You may easily get entangled in endless amusements and distractions that life offers and forget about things that truly matter. You collect as much information and knowledge as You can, and in this process You meet many people that can act as facilitators (travel, employment, services, or something more unusual). At a more intellectual level, gathering information allows You to see general trends in society as well as interests of individuals. Your most important ability is to be a well informed in one or more areas. It is possible that You identify Yourself with two or more philosophies or moral codes at the same time. Jupiter in this position may mean talent for writing, success in studies (languages, medicine), the possibility of studying abroad (Jupiter = foreign countries), twins (Jupiter = children), scholarships (Jupiter gives people support), studying overseas, education in adulthood, success in journalism, medicine or travelling.
