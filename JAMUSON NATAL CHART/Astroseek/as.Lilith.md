Lilith - Black Moon - Fascination and Denial

Lilith is a fictional point - the second empty focal point of elliptical orbit of the Moon around the Earth.
In mythology, Lilith refused to submit to Adam, rebelled against the connection between Adam and Eve, decided to escape from the world of people and made a connection with Satan.
In astrology, Lilith symbolizes either fascination or refusal of topics with which she is connected with. 
Both, the fascination or the rejection of the given topics, can eventually engulf the person and take him "away" from the human world.
