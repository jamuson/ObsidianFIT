Interpretations - Planets in Signs, Planets in Houses

* Planets describe a certain process of what is happening - eg. Mars fights, Saturn limits, Jupiter expands..
* Sign in which the planet is located determines how the planet is manifesting itself, for example Mars may manifest itself in a way Aries would behave (vigorously and irritably) or in the manner of Taurus (more slowly, gradually and consistently)
* Houses show special areas of everyday life, in which all this takes place. Location in a house shows whether, for example Mars manifests in relationships (7th house), employment (6th house), family (4th house) or elsewhere.

Hint:
Planets show us what is happening;
Signs show us how it is happening;
Houses show us where it is happening.
