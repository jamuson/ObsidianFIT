# **Venus in ![](https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-strelec.gif)Sagittarius**

People with Venus in Sagittarius are fully aware of the generosity and inexhaustibility of love. You may either have a great desire for love or lust. However, lust is not important to You because You are loyal and You never lose Your belief that love always leads to glory. From a philosophical point of view, it is clear to You that You can never experience good times without experiencing bad time too and that bad times in the present mean better times in the future. You perceive love as an adventure and Your search for true love can take You far away from home. You can find Your happiness or the person You want only beyond Your original and probably limited horizon. Your predictable family and love life or partner are not exactly what You wanted unless You stretch Your wings in Your youth and rebel enough to realize that love is an adventure, no matter where and with whom.
