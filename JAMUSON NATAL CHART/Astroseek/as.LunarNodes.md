Lunar Nodes - North Node and South Node

The Lunar Nodes aren’t planets, but rather astrology mathematical points, that are directly opposite each other in the chart. 
It is said, that your life purpose is encoded between them - in the line between North Node and South Node. 
The South Node indicates your comfort zone, your habitual place, 
while your North Node shows life lessons and what you’re striving for in this lifetime. 
Both Lunar Nodes are almost always retrogade.
