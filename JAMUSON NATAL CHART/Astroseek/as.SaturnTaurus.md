People with Saturn in Taurus need to learn to attribute the right value to things. You have a particularly good sense of material values, but You tend to underestimate the intangible or "invisible" things that are not immediately apparent at first glance. Money can become the source of Your worries and problems. You are either afraid of losing what You already own, You may have debts or not enough money. In the first case, You attach too much importance to material things, in the second case You probably do not take money seriously enough, and in the third case, You must realise that the supply of cash does not depend so much on external conditions, but rather on how rich one feels inside. The purpose of this life lesson is to gain a sense of balance and stop compensating for it by merely evaluating life from a material point of view, or to overlook this area.
