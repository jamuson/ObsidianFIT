## The Sun

The Sun represents vitality, a sense of individuality, and outward-shining creative energy.


### The Sun in Scorpio

Scorpios are known for their intensity. You are determined folk who absolutely throw Yourselves into whatever You do, but getting You to commit to something is rarely easy. In fact, it's better not to even try to "get You" to do anything. Solar Scorpios have their own mind. And, Your primary motivation is unlikely to be prestige (like Your Capricorn friends) or even authority (Leos can have that, too)--it's real power. Your power can be of the "behind the scenes" variety, just as long as You have it.

To others, Scorpios seem to have plenty of willpower. You probably do. Scorpios know what they want and won't go out and grab it at the wrong moment. You sit back, watch (quite expertly), and then get it only when the moment is just right. It might seem like patience, but it's more likely Your powerful skills at strategy at work. Scorpios aren't afraid of getting their hands (their bodies, their minds) dirty. The darker side of life intrigues You, and You're always ready to investigate.

Scorpios never give up. You have tremendous staying power. You're not in the slightest intimidated by anybody or anything. Confrontations are not a problem. In fact, talk to any Scorpio about Your life, and you'll probably be in awe at all they've gone through. Trauma seems to follow You wherever You go. When Scorpio learns optimism, instead of expecting the worst, you will find that You possess amazing regenerative powers -- the power to heal, create, and transform.

###### Short description:

Physical energy and courage. Strong passions. Regeneration and improvement. Strong sexual powers.

###### Potential issues:

You are suspicious, defiant, extremist; You are sometimes [[vocab.vindictive]].

%%Scorpio with ascendant Gemini %%
#### Sun in VI: The Sun in the sixth house

The work that you do and the services that you offer are very important to your sense of identity. To feel good about Yourself, you need to be busy with daily activities and produce work you can be proud of. Advice: Focus on finding a suitable and rewarding avenue for expressing this part of you, being extra careful to choose an occupation in which you can express Yourself. You are sensitive to criticism about your work, and you work best when you create your own schedule. Positive feedback for your services is important to you, but be careful not to over-identify with the appreciation you receive from others, as your work and your health suffer when you feel under-appreciated. Motivation to do a good job should come from within.

###### Key points:

You are helpful, concerned, detail-oriented, observant, competent but not hugely ambitious, and sometimes given to fretting. You could have many pets, various minor health issues or concerns, and a strong attachment to Your work or routine.

##### -97 Square between the Sun and Uranus

Your identity rides on your sense of personal freedom. It can be quite a challenge to get you to do what you don't want to do, simply because you see any attempts by others to push you in a certain direction as threatening to your sense of freedom. You are a very dynamic person who questions tradition and authority, yet, paradoxically, you can be quite set in your ways! Although a humanitarian in many ways, you can be a little [[vocab.brusque]] when it comes to sentimentality or what you perceive to be excessive attachment to the past or to tradition. You can have a lot of nervous energy and defensiveness. It can be difficult to hold a 9 to 5 job or to develop steady routines. You work best when you can manage your own schedule, and you work in spurts. When you are hit with creative inspiration, you are capable of tremendous effort. However, you can be quite temperamental, and it is very hard for you to pour your heart and soul into something that you don't "feel" for at the moment. You don't like superficiality or pretense, which is an admirable trait. However, your disdain for pretense can be problematic in a world where people are expected to perform whether You are inspired or not! You should try your best to channel your high levels of intuition, inventiveness, and spiritedness into creative endeavors or important causes. You might find that you encounter much less resistance in day-to-day life this way.

##### -70 Square between the Sun and Midheaven

You struggle with finding a career that suits your personality. You may not face up to problems, and Your plans are often difficult or even impossible for You to realize.

## The Moon

The Moon represents the emotional responses, unconscious pre-destination, and the self-image. The Moon represents the emotions, and the Moon sign shows how a person expresses Yourself when at home, at ease, and comfortable.


### The Moon in Pisces

Lunar Pisceans are known to be dreamy and not always in touch with reality. However, though You may not always show real-world savvy in day-to-day, practical affairs, You make up for this with remarkable intuition. You can put Yourself into anybody's shoes with extreme ease. On the plus side, this endows You with remarkable compassion and love. The downside of this apparent ability to break down boundaries is that You can easily lose Yourself in the suffering of others.

Your sense of humor is delightfully silly and a bit odd. These are perceptive souls who seem to be in touch with all the nuances and subtleties of human nature. Often this comes through in a strong sense of humor that is more of the receptive kind than the type of sense of humor that would make people the "life of the party." It's generally pretty easy to get You giggling.

Moon in Pisces people may get tagged as spaced out, but there's much more to You than meets the eye. You feel things out and rely on Your intuition--it just doesn't feel right for You to do otherwise. Your dreaminess can mean plenty of moments of absent-mindedness. These times of oblivion can land You in all sorts of predicaments with others who can too easily misunderstand these complex souls.

Without plenty of space and time to daydream, Pisces Moons easily get overloaded with life. Give Yourself room to be alone with Yourself, and You're generally able to take on the world--even if Your style is not always conventional or understandable when You do so.

Generally considered soft-hearted and sweet, Lunar Pisceans care about others and are easily touched by human suffering. This tendency gains You the reputation as suckers for sob stories. Although this may sometimes be true, many Lunar Pisceans learn, in Your lifetimes, how to discern between sincerity and manipulation. Still, You definitely do have plenty of soft corners.

In personal relationships, Lunar Pisceans are giving and yielding. You are generally open on a sexual level, quietly. Your fantasies can be far-reaching, intricate, and rich with emotion. Love is closely tied in with Your sexuality. Most Lunar Pisceans are shy; You need a trustworthy lover to bring You out.

There's a delightful accepting side to Moon in Pisces that is sometimes mistaken for weakness. Pisces is the twelfth and last sign of the zodiac and thus carries with it a little of each sign of the zodiac. As a result, You see Yourself reflected in the behavior of others, giving You seemingly boundless compassion. Since the Moon represents our instinctive nature, Moon in Pisces seems to know how things feel without actual experience. The ones that aren't too shy make awesome actors and actresses. This ability to empathize even in the absence of experience gives You an open mind and heart. Most long to express this through writing, music (both listening and making), poetry, and art -- in fact, the happiest people with this position do just that.

Most Pisces Moon people instinctively know when they're due for a much-needed recharge. It's at these times that You retreat from the world (and its harsh realities) only to gather the strength to face everything and everyone again. Solitude is important to You, but You also need people, so Your retreats will usually be short-lived. Pisces Moon individuals believe, and, let's face it, the world needs Piscean leaps of faith.

###### Short description:

Imaginative, sharp insights. You are impressionable, with abundant imagination. Gentle, warm, humorous, artistic.

###### Potential issues:

Troubles caused by too much sentimentality, worries, problems, unhealthy imagination, escapism, and nervousness.


#### Moon in X: The Moon in the tenth house


Changes of situation. You are concerned about getting old or feeling too dependent on others, tending to hark back to the past. Perhaps more strongly influenced by the father. Help from family or women can be notable on professional levels.

This position of the Moon indicates an emotional need for recognition, popularity, acknowledgment, and achievement. You may feel others expect a lot from you.

You can be quite charismatic. You are at your emotional best when you lead a structured and responsible life, but it can take time to get there. You may change your goals, ambitions, and/or your profession frequently in an attempt to find the perfect fit. There can be marked worries about living up to your image or the expectations of others. You could find that your private life becomes public more often than most.

At times, decisions may be too emotionally biased, or you might act on emotional whims far too often. Learning to set your own heartfelt goals is the challenge here, as it is unlikely you will find true happiness if you follow or adopt the expectations of others, which you are especially sensitive to. ==You are talented at taking on a nurturing or managerial role and quickly adapting to trends.== 

##### 115 Trine between the Moon and Mercury

You are quite expressive and animated in your speech. Not only do you have an outstanding memory, but you also pick up a lot of information from your environment. You love to chat and exchange ideas. Even if you are shy, once you're friends, you love to talk about pretty much anything under the sun, and you enjoy sharing stories from your past!

Much of the time, your communications tend to center around day-to-day activities more than grander philosophies. Naturally interested and approachable, others find you very easy to talk to. You are accommodating and curious, but you are not as well-equipped to handle heavy emotional demands. You thrive on change and variety. You might be a little addicted to gossip! More probably, however, you have a deep curiosity about others.

There is a twinkle in your eyes, and you are never short on humor. You are playful and versatile--you make a fun companion and an interesting friend. You listen! Yes, you do talk and occasionally interrupt in your excitement, but you are interested in what others have to say, which is a real pleasure. In fact, you are more able than most people to get others talking simply because you are very receptive and sympathetic. You also pick up others' feelings and body language readily.

###### Key traits:

You have sound judgment, a good memory. You are intelligent, imaginative, vivacious, and vibrant. You develop, adapt, and grow throughout life. This aspect combination adds a youthful, lively quality to the personality. There is a great need to express Yourself, whether through conversation or the written word. When emotions are overwhelming or stuck, writing could help. You may have an aptitude for, or interest in, learning foreign languages.

##### -36 Square between the Moon and Saturn

When the Moon is in hard aspect to Saturn in the natal chart, You need to learn to trust others more. Fear keeps You from fully enjoying personal relationships, and fear is behind the occasional rigidity that You express. When You let Yourself receive nurture or care from others, an inner voice cautions You that it might not be sincere, long-lasting, or enough! There can be some reluctance about becoming a parent, but once taken on, You don't take Your responsibility lightly.

Emotional reticence is the main theme of these aspects. Many people with this aspect had a lot of conditions placed on the love they received in early childhood. You tend to expect the same later in life. With hard Saturn aspects, individuals are often plagued with doubts, not only about the self but about what to expect from life itself. The problem is that expecting difficulties or negative situations creates an aura around You that perpetuates the problem. ==You must work hard at positive thinking and expecting more from life==. Ironically, many people with hard Saturn aspects can be quite sarcastic, skeptical, and rigid in manner. This is essentially a defense mechanism designed to protect Yourself from harshness in the world.

It is extremely likely that You feel neglected because You perceive it in the first place, and later expect it, to be the case. There's a vicious circle going on here that can only be broken when the patterns created by negative conditioning are broken. Adjusting one's perceptions and expectations is the key to breaking out of these negative patterns. Otherwise, natives of hard Moon-Saturn aspects will live life feeling left out--attracting circumstances that perpetuate a feeling of deep unhappiness and dissatisfaction.

###### Short description:
You have changeable moods, a reserved character, can be stubborn and may lack assurance. Your relationship with a guardian may have been difficult or a challenging early family life %%in some cases%%.

##### -81 Square between the Moon and Ascendant

You can be unhappily influenced by the family or childhood, or otherwise feel rather insecure about new beginnings and new situations. You may be always looking for more love, appreciation, and feedback. You are susceptible, perhaps with some superficial sensitivity and can sometimes be irascible, changeable, inconstant, and moody. However, You are usually highly intelligent, observant, and adaptable, and are very often misunderstood, projecting the wrong image more often than is comfortable.


## Mercury

Mercury represents communication, Cartesian and logical spirit.


### Mercury in Scorpio

You are extremely observant and astute, always reading between the lines and looking for the real meaning behind things. Passionate in speech, excellent at strategy. Natural psychologist.


#### Mercury in VI: Mercury in the sixth house


Medical profession. Serviceable and generous nature. May meet Your soul mate at work, or (if not) through family contacts.

You are a person who thinks of all the details that others forget. Your mind is almost always turned "on" which can make you a little nervous. You are excellent at sorting things out, organizing, and making lists and associations. With your attention to the details and the mechanics, however, you might miss the bigger point! ==You are exceptionally helpful and others can count on you for making arrangements, researching, and offering advice==. ==You truly love to feel useful==. ==You might have some traits of a hypochondriac==, as you notice all of the little aches and pains that others might overlook. Nervous tension could be at the root of many of your health complaints. Many of you are good at crafts, mechanics, or anything that requires good manual dexterity.

##### -40 Square between Mercury - Neptune

You misjudge, but very imaginative. You let things happen, and are happy in Your dreamworld. Confronted by reality, You are hesitant, anxious about being tested and can fall back into Your imaginary world.

##### -47 ▢ between Mercury - Lilith

Can be provocative in speech or communications, often challenging and contradicting, and seeing the flaws of a situation. You might be someone who holds back Your sensuality.


## Venus

Venus represents an interest in emotions and values, exchange, and sharing with others.


### Venus in Sagittarius

When Venus in Sagittarius people are in love, You need to feel You can grow and expand Your horizons through Your relationship. You want to learn new things, and experience everything together. ==You are an idealistic lover who wants them to appreciate their beliefs, visions, and ideals==. ==You can be a confusing mix of the lighthearted and serious==. You are a roamer and a seeker, and don't commit in Your relationships as easily as others. You turn others on with Your big smiles and laughs, Your jokes, Your grand schemes, Your dreams, and Your friendly, flirtatious behavior. ==You pride Yourself on Your open mind, but you may notice You can be judgmental too==. You are threatened by inhibitions on the part of Your lover, dullness, and emotional overkill. You are restless, and won't put up with lovers who dwell on any one thing. When the going gets tough in Your relationship, You have an overwhelming need to run away. Usually this only means getting out and experiencing something new before You come back, but sometimes it can be for good. You are attracted to people who are in love with life. They don't need to be refined, polished, or graceful to win Your favor.

Pleasing Venus in Sagittarius involves allowing You lots of room in the relationship to grow. Avoid getting stuck in a rut, and understand Your need to move on. Learn to laugh, but take Your rants and raves seriously. Avoid criticizing Your beliefs, join You in debates, and philosophize along with You. When You feel the need for more experience, join You! Learn to look past Your clumsiness with you and your feelings, and avoid cornering You or forcing You to commit.


#### Venus in VII: Venus in the seventh house


Your fate can depend a lot on partnership. May connect for love, children, happy emotional life.

Harmony is most important to you, so it is unlikely you will attempt to dominate a lover. You are a peacemaker, sometimes going to great lengths to achieve a balanced, harmonious relationship. Be careful not to bend over backwards just to keep the peace--you may be taken advantage of. Your marriage partner may be especially attractive, charming, or well off. You are extremely attractive, agreeable, and charming, drawing others to you magnetically. You need an unusual amount of contact and exchange with a partner, and might find that you feel completely lost without one. Some of you might quickly enter into partnerships, perhaps too quickly and neither equipped nor prepared for the responsibilities that a long-term relationship demands. In some cases, there can be a shallow or materialistic interest in partners. Your hips and lower back may be special erogenous zones for you, or You may be especially attractive body parts.

##### 25 ✶ between Venus - Uranus

Independent in love. Your love life is rich, but possibly with passing love affairs. You can tire quickly and can be scared of losing Your liberty. Traditional marriage may not be for You. You have that little something that attracts others. You like amorous adventures or unusual pastimes, You are romantic, although a little detached or unpredictable. You are the eternal lover and are more likely to break something off than live untruly. You like art, anything new.

The ability to get along with--and accept--people from all walks of life as friends is strong with this position. You can readily see through insincerity in others. In relationships, tolerance is the most important "ingredient" to You. Your sexual preferences can be somewhat unconventional, and You may not be happy with a partner who tries to limit Your sexual expression. You are usually quite capable of maintaining relationships that require a great deal of freedom and tolerance, such as long-distance romances or set-ups in which partners are unable to see each other consistently. Your style in love can be somewhat free and breezy, and possibly noncommittal. You quite naturally accept the idea that Your partner might need some personal space and freedom.

##### 2 Conjunction between Venus - Pluto

Your emotional and sex life can be powerful and rich. You live out truly passionate love affairs. Extremely resourceful, ==You are also excellent at determining the worth or value of material things==. You can help others to discover their own worth as well. You are naturally attracted to relationships that transform You, that are growing and evolving, and that are intense. You can use Your strong intuition and understanding of others for good or for bad, and this depends largely on other aspects in the chart. You can be highly devoted and passionate to the things (and people) You love. You can be quite persuasive.


## Mars

Mars represents the desire for action and physical energy.


### Mars in Libra

Mars in Libra natives often reflect about things before tey act. Decisiveness is not Your strong point, but You do, eventually, get things done. Many people with this position procrastinate, generally because You feel the need to weigh all of the alternatives before taking action.

Life isn't always fair%%, as Mars in Scorpio would say,%% but Mars in Libra will seldom accept this notion. These natives can easily get caught up in defending Yourself and others. ==Although Your overall goal is to live peacefully, You stir others up with Your desire to balance everything==. Still, ==You always play innocent when You are challenged, and can generally charm the birds out of the trees to win your favor==. ==Passive-aggressiveness is practically the hallmark of this position. You don't want to look like You are ever being mean or unfair, but aggression has to go somewhere! Too often, this results in sneaky behavior and subterfuge==. On the other hand, some Mars in Libra people turn the Mars energy into action, and You fight for Libran justice and fairness in the world. On the up side, Mars in Libra people are adept at predicting when problems and discord will occur well in advance. You know how to compromise and are excellent at conflict management.


#### Mars in V: Mars in the fifth house


Spontaneous nature. You like games or competitive sports. You take professional risks. A great worker, You like everything that can be done quickly and become impatient with things that hang around for too long. It is the same for Your emotional life: no candy-floss or fine speeches, You get directly to the point.

==You have a strong love of pleasure, and you tend to directly and perhaps impulsively pursue romance==. Many of you are sports lovers, and anything with an element of risk appeals to you or entertains you. You put a lot of energy into the pursuit of entertainment, satisfaction, games, and pleasure. You may be a very active hobbyist. You tend to be very playful and demonstrative, and you could really enjoy putting on a show. You can be very competitive. If you have children, You may be especially active and boisterous.

##### 2 🛆 between Mars - Jupiter

You have a good sense of organization, You are jovial, frank, and sincere. You are full of dynamism and abundant energy. You love life, taking all it has to offer. You like sports and the outdoor life. You are successful professionally and emotionally. ==You may have many children or projects and ventures==.

==You are honest and forthright in Your dealings with others, and You tend to trust others readily==. ==You can be a bit careless about spending money, however, and this is probably because You are so eternally optimistic that there will always be plenty around==. The possibility of failure does not enter Your mind, although success itself is not as important to You as enjoyment and happiness are. Can be pleasantly competitive and good-humored.

##### 47 🛆 between Mars - Saturn

You are energetic and determined. You have strength and resistance, ability and patience. You are tough, and sometimes insensitive, putting much of Your energy and talents into overcoming all the obstacles to Your success. You are obstinate, calculating, aiming not to take on anything without having thought of all the possible consequences. You can take all the time in the world, rarely losing patience to achieve Your objectives. Even if impatience is indicated in other areas of the chart, this Mars-Saturn placement suggests an overall persistence in the long-term. You are not necessarily especially sociable unless other indications strongly suggest so, but respected. There is a reverence for order and following rules to keep order, for the most part.

##### 37 🛆 between Mars - Neptune

Your feelings are dominated by wisdom, intuition, and instinct and geared towards the ideal. You like water, sea voyages. You like odd people, situations. Can often use a gentle approach to pursuing desires.

##### 24 🛆 between Mars - Lilith

Love affairs are passionate. There is an instinctive understanding of intensity, the dark side of our natures, and passion.

_House I_ is the area of self identity. The ascendant is a symbol of how one acts in life. It is the image of the personality as seen by others, and the attitude that one has towards life.
%%
Scorpio with ascendant Gemini
^^why is this even here???^^
%%

#### Ascendant is Gemini

Those born with Gemini rising see the world as a place to learn. You are curious about the people around You. %%Sounds similar to Sagittarius rising? Well it is, but there are some important differences. While Sagittarius seeks to expand Your mental and physical horizons in a broad sense, %%Gemini is mostly interested in moving about in Your social circles. These are people who love to ask questions, to move around freely, and to mingle. ==Definitely restless and often quick in physical expression, natives of the Gemini Ascendant exude an air of impatience even if You don't mean it==. In fact, there is a cleverness to Gemini Ascendants that can intimidate some, especially sensitive folk. ==Your facility with words can be a wonderful asset, although sometimes Gemini rising individuals identify too much with Your mental agility and forget, in Your personal interactions and communications, to nurture the people around You. A certain lack of warmth in presentation can be the result, and although this style is generally a facade, it is not immediately apparent to most==. People with, for example, predominant Water signs may feel a little ill at ease with Gemini rising people (that is, before You get to know You more personally), while strong Air types more fully appreciate the fun and cleverness of these individuals.

I have found two styles of presentation most common with Gemini rising people. One style is bubbly, changeable, talkative, and a little quirky. These natives are interesting and fun. You constantly explain things, whether it's Your own behavior and opinion or those of the world around You. Another distinct "style" is a rather cool and intellectual demeanor. These natives are often quite witty and clever, but You present Yourself in a less cheerful and changeable way than the first group. Your observations are sharp and the overall manner is a tad [[vocab.brusque]]. No matter the style, Gemini rising natives are given to analysis and making sense of Your world. Your powers of observation are well-developed, You are mentally active (more often than not, Your mind is racing!), and You almost always have something bright or witty to say. It is easy for individuals with this position to get sidetracked, as Your curiosity is large, Your mind is quick, and Your attention span rather short! As children, natives born with a Gemini Ascendant are often labeled as the intellectual, inquisitive, and perhaps odd child. Many feel Your upbringing lacked some warmth. In one-to-one relationships, Gemini rising people often seek a certain amount of personal freedom and space. You enjoy intellectual debates and exchanging ideas. Although You often demand a fair amount of freedom, You are often just as willing to give Your partners room to breathe.

---

Cancer on House III

House VI - the sixth house - is the area of learning by material transaction.

Libra on House VI

House VII - the seventh house - is the area of one-to-one relationships such as marriage and partnership, and of social and intellectual action.

A union with a foreigner or a marriage abroad. You seek happiness and intellectual companionship more than anything.

---
House VIII - the eighth house - is the area of emotional security and of security of the soul.

Sagittarius on House VIII

This can point to profit through an inheritance, or it may suggest that support is often there for You when needed most, and a partner is likely to be financially stable or supportive. However, You may not always be firm and accountable with matters ruled by the eighth house, so watch for sloppiness or excess here.

---
