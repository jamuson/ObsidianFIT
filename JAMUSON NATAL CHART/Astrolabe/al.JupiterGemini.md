You have a logical, detached, objective view of most things. 
Your interests are wide-ranging and you are an avid student, with expertise in many different areas. 
You love to work things out in your mind -- everything you do is reduced to an exercise in logic and reason. 
You have the ability to grasp abstractions and to deal successfully with the larger issues of life. 
Your overemphasis on developing your powerful intellect can cause your emotional and intuitive abilities to atrophy unless you consciously choose to exercise them.
