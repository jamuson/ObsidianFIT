You are a born investigator. 
You are fascinated by secrets and mysteries and unanswered questions of any kind. 
When you become upset or angry, your emotional reactions are overpowering -- reason and logic disappear in an uncontrollable passionate outburst. 
You tend to keep your thoughts secret and bottled up and this makes others regard you with suspicion. 
It is not that you are trying purposely to be evasive, it is just that you would rather not deal with the explosions and hassles that often occur when you reveal your true feelings and opinions. 
Your sense of humor tends toward sarcasm and irony.
