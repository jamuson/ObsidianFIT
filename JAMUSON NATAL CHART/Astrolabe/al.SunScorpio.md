Intense and complex by nature, you have extremely strong emotional reactions to most situations. 
Feelings are often very difficult for you to verbalize. 
Therefore you have a tendency to be very quiet - - to brood and think a lot. 
You seldom get overtly angry, but, when you do, you are furious and unforgiving. 
When you make an emotional commitment, it is total -- you are not attracted to superficial or casual relationships. 
If you are challenged, you take it as a personal affront and tend to lash out and fight back in a vengeful manner. 
You love mysteries and the supernatural. 
A good detective, you love getting to the roots of problems and you enjoy finding out what makes other people tick. 
You are known to be very willful, very powerful and quite tenacious!
