You genuinely enjoy meeting other people, but you're at your best if you can do so from the comfort of your own home. 
You prefer others to come to you and tend to feel uncomfortable about leaving your home or neighborhood for any extended period of time. 
Those who do come in contact with you are struck by your caring and obliging nature -- you really make them feel at home. 
You form the closest ties, however, with members of your immediate family, especially your parents and children. 
You're at your best attending or organizing family reunions!
