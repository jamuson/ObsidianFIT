Extremely active by nature, you like to get around, meet people and do different things. 
Very restless, you just can't seem to stay put. 
You need to be involved in several projects at once in order to keep your mind stimulated. 
You like to read books and to write letters and to talk -- constantly. 
Seemingly ageless, you will always appear to be much younger than you really are. 
Very adaptable and inquisitive, you are always open to new ideas and experiences. 
A "jack-of-all-trades", you are lively and versatile. 
Because of the high nervous tension that you always seem to have, athletic activity would be a good way for you to burn off energy. 
But be careful of a tendency to experience things only superficially -- try to dig in and absorb things at a deeper level.
