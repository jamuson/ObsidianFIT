# Natal Chart Report
#### Introduction to Your Birth Chart Report

What follows is your personal natal chart information, as well as interpretations of the positions and aspects in your chart.

With this report, you'll find out the positions of the planets in your natal chart by sign. The most personal of these are the Sun sign, Moon sign, Mercury sign, Venus sign, and Mars sign. Most people already know their Sun sign.

If your time of birth is known, you will also find out your Ascendant, or rising sign, as well as the positions of the planets in the houses of your chart. Additionally, aspects between the planets are listed and interpreted.

If the birth time is unknown, we cannot know the Ascendant or house positions. The natal chart shown here is an Aries chart in that case. Additionally, you may not know the Moon sign for certain. This is because the Moon changes signs approximately every 2-1/2 days. Less probable but still possible is a change of signs for the other planets and luminaries, depending on the planet itself (for example, the Sun changes signs every 30 days or so).

Each paragraph of interpretation refers to an individual position in your chart. All of these positions and aspects are some of the "parts" that make up a "whole"--you! Some of these interpretations will be contradictory, just as people are contradictory. A person can be timid in love and aggressive in business, for example. As well, we evolve and grow throughout our lives, facing challenges that help us to handle our positions and aspects in a different way. We all have choices, and one of the major benefits of astrology is the chance to understand ourselves so that we can work with our natal charts and improve ourselves. Any computerized report that interprets the individual placements in a natal chart is somewhat disjointed, simply because the different parts that make up the whole are not synthesized.

Some of the interpretations are more detailed than others. You can use this as a starting point and do some further reading about different positions (such as Moon in Libra, Saturn in the 10th house, Moon conjunct Mercury) in your chart by exploring our own site, other astrology sites, and by reading astrology books.

The tables show the technical details of your natal chart, personalized based on your birth data. Below the tables, you'll find your free birth chart interpretive report, and a chart wheel appears at the end of the report.

#### Planet Positions, Ascendant, & Houses

The following table shows the position of the planets in your chart, by sign and degree. You will also find the sign of your Ascendant and the signs on the cusp of each house in your natal chart only if the birth time is known. The Roman Numerals refer to the houses, where the Ascendant is also the first house and the Midheaven is also the tenth house. For example, if the sign Taurus is next to Mars, you know your Mars is in Taurus. If the sign Libra is next to Venus, you know your Venus is in Libra. If Cancer is next to Ascendant, you have a Cancer Ascendant, and if Leo is next to II, Leo is on your 2nd house.
