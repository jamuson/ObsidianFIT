Scorpios are known for their intensity. You are determined folk who absolutely throw Yourselves into whatever You do, but getting You to commit to something is rarely easy. In fact, it's better not to even try to "get You" to do anything. Solar Scorpios have their own mind. And, Your primary motivation is unlikely to be prestige (like Your Capricorn friends) or even authority (Leos can have that, too)--it's real power. Your power can be of the "behind the scenes" variety, just as long as You have it.

To others, Scorpios seem to have plenty of willpower. You probably do. Scorpios know what they want and won't go out and grab it at the wrong moment. You sit back, watch (quite expertly), and then get it only when the moment is just right. It might seem like patience, but it's more likely Your powerful skills at strategy at work. Scorpios aren't afraid of getting their hands (their bodies, their minds) dirty. The darker side of life intrigues You, and You're always ready to investigate.

Scorpios never give up. You have tremendous staying power. You're not in the slightest intimidated by anybody or anything. Confrontations are not a problem. In fact, talk to any Scorpio about Your life, and you'll probably be in awe at all they've gone through. Trauma seems to follow You wherever You go. When Scorpio learns optimism, instead of expecting the worst, you will find that You possess amazing regenerative powers -- the power to heal, create, and transform.

#### Short description:

The work that you do and the services that you offer are very important to your sense of identity. To feel good about Yourself, you need to be busy with daily activities and produce work you can be proud of. Advice: Focus on finding a suitable and rewarding avenue for expressing this part of you, being extra careful to choose an occupation in which you can express Yourself. You are sensitive to criticism about your work, and you work best when you create your own schedule. Positive feedback for your services is important to you, but be careful not to over-identify with the appreciation you receive from others, as your work and your health suffer when you feel under-appreciated. Motivation to do a good job should come from within.

#### Key points:

You are helpful, concerned, detail-oriented, observant, competent but not hugely ambitious, and sometimes given to fretting. You could have many pets, various minor health issues or concerns, and a strong attachment to Your work or routine.

Your identity rides on your sense of personal freedom. It can be quite a challenge to get you to do what you don't want to do, simply because you see any attempts by others to push you in a certain direction as threatening to your sense of freedom. You are a very dynamic person who questions tradition and authority, yet, paradoxically, you can be quite set in your ways! Although a humanitarian in many ways, you can be a little [[vocab.brusque]] when it comes to sentimentality or what you perceive to be excessive attachment to the past or to tradition. You can have a lot of nervous energy and defensiveness. It can be difficult to hold a 9 to 5 job or to develop steady routines. You work best when you can manage your own schedule, and you work in spurts. When you are hit with creative inspiration, you are capable of tremendous effort. However, you can be quite temperamental, and it is very hard for you to pour your heart and soul into something that you don't "feel" for at the moment. You don't like superficiality or pretense, which is an admirable trait. However, your disdain for pretense can be problematic in a world where people are expected to perform whether You are inspired or not! You should try your best to channel your high levels of intuition, inventiveness, and spiritedness into creative endeavors or important causes. You might find that you encounter much less resistance in day-to-day life this way.
