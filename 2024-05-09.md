ARE YOU A, GOAT?
ARE YOU, A SACRIFICE?
WE ALL GET, SACRIFICED
BUT WE CAN HAVE A SAY IN BY WHO AND HOW.

The following lines suggest a broader reflection on the inevitability of sacrifice in life, but also hint at the idea that individuals can exert some level of control or influence over the process. It seems to imply that while sacrifices are a part of life, individuals have the power to shape the circumstances and outcomes of those sacrifices.

Homelander is the egregore of AMERICA manifest

This statement appears to blend elements from pop culture and esoteric concepts. "Homelander" likely refers to a character from the TV series "The Boys," known for embodying an exaggerated, almost mythical version of American patriotism and power. "Egregore" is a term from occultism, referring to a thought form or collective energy created and sustained by the beliefs and actions of a group of people. So, the statement could be suggesting that Homelander represents an embodiment or manifestation of the collective ideals, values, and myths of America, echoing its cultural and political landscape.
